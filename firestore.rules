/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Emoji Match Challenge game.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows public read access to player scores while restricting write access to prevent unauthorized modifications.
 * Administrative access for leaderboard viewing is controlled by membership in the `admins` collection.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - `/player_scores/{playerScoreId}`: Stores individual player scores. Publicly readable.
 * - `/admins/{adminId}`: Stores admin user IDs. Existence in this collection grants admin privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Player scores are publicly readable but only writable with a valid authentication token.
 * - The `admins` collection restricts leaderboard access to authorized personnel.
 * - Listing of `admins` is disallowed.
