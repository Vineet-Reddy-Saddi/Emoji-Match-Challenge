/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Emoji Match Challenge game.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a role-based access control model where only authenticated admins
 * can view player scores, while anyone can submit their score.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /player_scores/{playerScoreId}: Stores individual player scores. Accessible for creation by anyone.
 * - /admins/{adminId}: Stores the IDs of admin users. Only admins can read this.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public score submissions: Anyone can submit a score, but only admins can view all scores.
 * - Admin role: Admin status is determined by the presence of their UID in the `/admins` collection.
 * - No user listing: The rules explicitly prevent listing all documents in the `/admins` collection.
